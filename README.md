# Data Science Study Notes ðŸ“š

As part of my Full Stack Development journey, I contributed to fellow students by sharing and recording knowledge and helping others improve their skills. This experience allowed me to strengthen what Iâ€™ve learned and make valuable contributions to the community. You can explore my Full Stack Development study notes [here](https://github.com/jgchoti/studynote).

Welcome to my study notes, where I document everything I learn through my self-study journey into Data Science. These notes serve as both a personal reference and a useful resource for anyone interested in the field.

## Purpose of This Note

1. **Personal Reference:** This document helps solidify my understanding of key Data Science concepts, tools, and techniques through self-study.

2. **Future Resource:** It will act as a quick reference guide for me in the future, assisting in revisiting topics when needed.

## Disclaimer

I want to emphasize that while I've put effort into compiling accurate information, I **cannot** guarantee the correctness of this note. I encourage **cross-referencing** with reliable sources to verify any information.
