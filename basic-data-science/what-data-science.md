# What is Data Science?

Data Science is about using data to make decisions, understand things, and predict the future.

## What Can Data Do?

- **Describe**: Data can show us things about the present, like how much energy we use.
- **Detect**: It helps find unusual events, like fraudulent purchases.
- **Diagnose**: Data can help us understand whatâ€™s happening and why, like recommending music based on your activity on Spotify.
- **Predict**: We can use data to predict future events, like estimating how a population will grow.

- **Collect Data**: Gather data from many sources, like surveys, social media, and transactions.
- **Store Data**: Safely save the data in an organized way.
- **Prepare Data**: Clean the data by fixing errors (e.g., missing values or duplicates) and organizing it.
- **Explore and Visualize Data**: Look at the data using charts or graphs, like building dashboards to track changes over time.
- **Run Experiments and Predictions**: Use data to test ideas, make predictions (like forecasting temperature), or improve processes (like finding the best web page design for customer engagement).
